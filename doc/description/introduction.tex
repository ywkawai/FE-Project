\section{What is SCALE-DG?}
FE-project provides a library and sample programs for the discontinuous Galerkin methods (DGM). 
Furthermore, we provide an atmospheric model with a regional/global dynamical core based on DGM, SCALE-DG.
In FE-Project, we use scalable Computing for Advanced Library and Environment (SCALE),
which is a basic software library of weather and climate models of the earth and planets intended for widespread use.


The general references of SCALE-DG are \cite{KT2023NumAccuracyDG,KT2025SCALEDG}. 
If SCALE-DG is used in your studies, 
please cite two our papers in addition to the reference papers of SCALE library \citep{nishizawa2015influence,sato2015impacts}.
