\section{Introduction} \label{sec:ideal_exp_intro}


In this chapter, 
the basic operations of \scaledg are explained by conducting a test case of mountain wave. 
It is recommended that the users perform this tutorial 
because it includes a check for whether the compilation of SCALE in Part \ref{part:install} has been completed. 
This chapter assumes that the following file has been already generated:
\begin{alltt}
  FE-Project-{\version}/model/atm_nonhydro3d/test/case/mountain_wave/scale-rm
  FE-Project-{\version}/model/atm_nonhydro3d/test/case/mountain_wave/scale-rm_init
  FE-Project-{\version}/model/atm_nonhydro3d/test/case/mountain_wave/scale-rm_pp
  FE-Project-{\version}/bin/regrid_tool
\end{alltt}
Furthermore, 
python scripts are used as a visualization tool. 

The tutorial is described in order of preparation: creating the initial data, conducting the simulation, 
post-processing the output, 
and visualize the results.
