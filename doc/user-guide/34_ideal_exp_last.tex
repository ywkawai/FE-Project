\section{Guideline for further studies} \label{sec:ideal_exp_last}

In this chapter,
the strategy for the execution of \scaledg was explained by using a simple idealized test. 
We recommend studying procedures of changing the model resolution, 
the calculation domain, and the number of MPI processes for further study. 
With regard to the idealized experiment, several files of other configurations, 
e.g., to increase resolution, the number of domains, and the physical schemes, are prepared in the directory ``sample'' under the same directory as was used in this experiment. 
These configuration files are useful to change such configurations.  
Moreover, various idealized experimental settings  have been prepared in the directory ``\verb|model/atm_nonhydro3d/test/case|.'' 
The procedures for the generation of the initial conditions and those for simulation execution are the same as in the tutorial in this chapter.

It is important to study the strategies for the configuration of physical processes, such as cloud microphysics, radiation, and turbulence schemes. 
They are described in Part \ref{part:basic_usel}.
