\section{Setting the topography} \label{subsec:basic_usel_topo}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------

\scaledg employs the terrain-following coordinates to represent topography.
In these coordinates, 
the bottom face of the lowest grid is given such that it can follow the surface altitude, i.e., topography.
Topography data used in the program \verb|scale-dg_init| and \verb|scale-dg| should be prepared in \scalelib format beforehand, except for some idealized experiments.
% \scaledg has a pre-processing function to convert external topography data to the format.
